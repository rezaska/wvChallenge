# Engineering Challenge
This is a challenge I did a few weeks ago using TypeScript. 

## Scenario
Imagine that the design team has recognized two places that use a similar UI component to provide **insights** to our users. We want to formalize this by implementing a reusable component in our design library. (Think of this component as a Lego block that can be used in multiple places.) You have been provided with the Figma file outlining the design details of this component.

## Project requirements

1. Implement the Insights component as a React component, using Typescript or Javascript.
![insights component preview](./assets/insights-component-preview.png "insights component preview")

2.  Implement styling for the Insights component using SCSS or vanilla CSS. (The project is set up to support either.)  
    a) The Figma designs use [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lato:wght@400;700) as the font (Regular and Bold). This font is available through Google fonts.

3. Use Typescript or PropTypes to define appropriate datatypes for your component.
4. Implement the component to work **on at least one** of the following sizes as defined in the Figma file:  
    a) Wide screen sizes  
    b) Medium screen sizes  
    c) Narrow screen sizes
5. Update the [App.tsx](./src/App.tsx) file to render/use your insights component.
6. Optional: Write test(s) for your component.
We know you might be pressed for time, so we wonâ€™t consider the absence of tests as a negative. (The project is set up to use Enzyme or React Testing Library)
